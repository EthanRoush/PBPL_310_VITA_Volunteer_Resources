          <h2>Introduction to the VITA Tax Clinic</h2>

          <p class="lead">In PBPL-310:Tax Policy and Inequality in Hartford, students have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the processes and real world implications of tax preparation, both academically and practically, through our partnership with the VITA Tax Clinic program. Whether or not you have taken the course for the available internship credit, you will be provided basic level tax preparation training, and expected to complete 1-2 four hour shifts per week, gaining hands on experience preparing tax returns for Hartford locals throughout the Spring semester.</p>

          <p>
<a href="https://antonioguirola.wixsite.com/trinityvita"><strong>Trinfo Cafe</strong></a> , located just off of campus on 1300 Broad St, is Trinity College's community space, and our site for hosting the VITA Tax Clinic. While all students will be volunteering at this site, those who are taking the course for an internship credit will be expected to complete a second 4 hour shift per week (36 hours total), often at another local VITA site, including <a href="https://thevillage.org/programs/volunteer-income-tax-assistance-vita/"><strong>The Village</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.crtct.org/programs/basic-needs/vita-tax-preparation-services/"><strong>CRT</strong></a>.
</p>

           <p>The slideshow below provides an introduction both to the Trinfo site, and to your upcoming role as a VITA volunteer:</p>

          <h2>Understanding the 1040</h2>
         
          <p class="lead">The 1040 form is our best resource to break down and explain the results of a client's return. With the document you will be able to locate a client's AGI, Taxable Income, Credits, as well as their Refund.</p>

          <p>In our roles as tax preparers, it is important to be able to identify and make sense of these numbers so that we can explain how much tax liability the client owes, or how much refundable credit they can expect to recieve. The VITA program caters expecially to lower income tax filers, meaning that many will be qualified to recieve a refund. When a client is expecting a refund but instead owes, it is essential that VITA volunteers are able to explain why, using the resources available on the 1040 form.</p>

           <p>The slideshow below is a helpful guide to understand where to find the most important information on the 1040 form, and how to communicate the results to the client:</p>

          <h2>Conclusions</h2>

          <p>Our collaboration with the Center for Leadership & Justice (CLJ) and the Greater Hartford Interfaith Action Alliance (GHIAA) has been instrumental in understanding community-driven approaches to social change and addressing Connecticut's housing crisis. CLJ’s focus on grassroots organizing and multi-faith leadership empowers communities to tackle systemic barriers to racial, social, and economic justice, while GHIAA's targeted initiatives address homelessness, housing reform, and economic disparities. A key aspect of GHIAA's work is advocating for Fair Share Planning & Zoning, a strategy designed to create 40,000 new affordable housing units statewide over the next decade. This comprehensive plan seeks to dismantle decades of discriminatory housing practices by allocating housing needs across towns, taking into account factors like income, housing stock, and poverty rates.</p>
          

          <p>In partnership with CLJ and GHIAA, our research focuses on analyzing census tract data across Hartford, West Hartford, East Hartford, Bloomfield, and Windsor to uncover patterns in housing concentration, ownership dynamics, and residential stability. These findings aim to provide actionable insights for policymakers and community advocates, enabling targeted interventions to combat housing instability and foster equitable development. By aligning data-driven strategies with the goals of Fair Share Planning & Zoning, this initiative supports a more inclusive vision for Connecticut's future, ensuring vulnerable populations have access to stable and affordable housing while promoting integrated and sustainable communities.

          <h2>Methodologies</h2>

          <p class="lead">Errors and Issues</p> 
          
          <p>There were issues with missing data in the dataset, specifically the total number of renters or renters after one year for certain areas. Additionally, the Census tract IDs were not in the proper format for the data visualization tool, Datawrapper, to correctly correlate the data with geographic locations. To address this, I identified that the Census tract IDs were missing a "003" prefix. I updated the IDs in the spreadsheet to include the missing prefix, which allowed the data to be properly imported and mapped in Datawrapper. The corrected data can now be used to create an accurate choropleth map visualizing residential stability patterns across the region. In order to find our specific 86 census tracts of relevance, we were able to identify the specific tract codes for each of the five municipalities, and command F search for all relevant results within the overall data set including all connecticut tracts. Then, in order for these tract codes to be readable by DataWrapper, we used a sheets formula to add 003 to the start of each code, allowing for DataWrapper to match each code to a polygon within its census tract map.</p>

          <h2>Introduction to the VITA Tax Clinic</h2>

          <p class="lead">In PBPL-310:Tax Policy and Inequality in Hartford, students have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the processes and real world implications of tax preparation, both academically and practically, through our partnership with the VITA Tax Clinic program. Whether or not you have taken the course for the available internship credit, you will be provided basic level tax preparation training, and expected to complete 1-2 four hour shifts per week, gaining hands on experience preparing tax returns for Hartford locals throughout the Spring semester.</p>

          <p>
<a href="https://antonioguirola.wixsite.com/trinityvita"><strong>Trinfo Cafe</strong></a> , located just off of campus on 1300 Broad St, is Trinity College's community space, and our site for hosting the VITA Tax Clinic. While all students will be volunteering at this site, those who are taking the course for an internship credit will be expected to complete a second 4 hour shift per week (36 hours total), often at another local VITA site, including <a href="https://thevillage.org/programs/volunteer-income-tax-assistance-vita/"><strong>The Village</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.crtct.org/programs/basic-needs/vita-tax-preparation-services/"><strong>CRT</strong></a>.
</p>

           <p>The slideshow below provides an introduction both to the Trinfo site, and to your upcoming role as a VITA volunteer:</p>

          <h2>Understanding the 1040</h2>
         
          <p class="lead">The 1040 form is our best resource to break down and explain the results of a client's return. With the document you will be able to locate a client's AGI, Taxable Income, Credits, as well as their Refund.</p>

          <p>In our roles as tax preparers, it is important to be able to identify and make sense of these numbers so that we can explain how much tax liability the client owes, or how much refundable credit they can expect to recieve. The VITA program caters expecially to lower income tax filers, meaning that many will be qualified to recieve a refund. When a client is expecting a refund but instead owes, it is essential that VITA volunteers are able to explain why, using the resources available on the 1040 form.</p>

           <p>The slideshow below is a helpful guide to understand where to find the most important information on the 1040 form, and how to communicate the results to the client:</p>

          <h2>Dependency Status</h2>

          <p>One of the first steps in completing a tax return is to determine the dependency status of the client. This step is crucial, as clients with qualifying dependents are eligible for the filing status "Head of Household" and are given a credit which substantially reduces their tax liability. Additionally, credits such as the CTC (Child Tax Credit) are only available to filers with children, and these credits and deductions are pivotal in determining how much a client owes or receives through a refund. The resource provided below offers a step by step guide to determining a client's dependency status, as well as useful sample scenarios: c</p>

          <h2>Guide to Understanding the W-2 and W-4 Forms</h2>

          <p class="lead">For basic level tax preparation, it is most important to be able to understand the W-2 form, and correctly input the information. The W-2 form is sent to the client from their employer, and primarily lists the total amount earned at that job during the tax year, as well as the amount of taxes withheld, which is crucial in the calculation of a client's tax liability. Based on the employment circumstances of the tax year, a client may have multiple W-2 forms or none at all. When there are multiple W-2s, the summation of the total income earned, as well as taxes withheld are the key variables in the automated calculation of a client's AGI and tax liability for that tax year</p> 
          
          <p>The W-4 form is less essential for basic preparers, but important to understand in terms of a client's tax liabiliy. The W-4 form is filled out by employees to  inform their employer how much federal income tax to withhold from their paycheck. withholding taxes on each paycheck ensures that taxes are paid gradually throughout the year rather than in a lump sum at tax time. Most often when a client is surprised at how much they owe, or at the lack of a refund, it is due to their paycheck withholding having been too low. Employees can change their withholding through their employers, and it is important that we as preparers are able to suggest this to clients, who may be hit with unexpedly large tax liability during their return. The video below is useful to understand both the W-2 and W-4 forms and their significance, with the W-4 explanation beginning at timestamp 2:20.</p>

          <h2>State Property Tax Credit</h2>

           <p class="lead">Most of basic level tax preparation focuses on the Federal side of the return, but it is important to identify and correctly list any property taxes paid by the client throughout the tax year on the State side of the return. If a client has a vehicle under their name that they paid taxes on during the tax year, this amount can be listed as a deduction on their State return, which will alleviate up to 300$ of State taxes on their return. </p> 

 <p>While clients may come prepared with receipts for their property tax payments, this is often not the case, and it is up to us the preparers to locate and input these property taxes using State government websites as our resource. This is easier than it sounds using the Tax Bill website for the City or locality where the taxes were paid. For our work with VITA, this will most often be the <a href="https://www.mytaxbill.org/inet/bill/home.do?town=hartford"><strong>City of Hartford Tax Bill Site</strong></a> , where all relevant taxes can be found with a search of a client's last name and first name initial. This entire process is summarized with step by step instructions in the slideshow below:</p>
